This is an attempt to get the gist https://gist.github.com/katowulf/c23855f2b376be30bff1 running.

to run the standalone token generator "node auth-server.js"
You can visit localhost:8010/token/tom or localhost:8010/token/ADMIN/tom
to generate non-admin or admin token that can be used to authenticate against our Firebase

Never managed to get the tests running though :(
